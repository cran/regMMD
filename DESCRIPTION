Title: Robust Regression and Estimation Through Maximum Mean
        Discrepancy Minimization
Description: The functions in this package compute robust estimators by minimizing a kernel-based distance known as MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) between the sample and a statistical model. Recent works proved that these estimators enjoy a universal consistency property, and are extremely robust to outliers. Various optimization algorithms are implemented: stochastic gradient is available for most models, but the package also allows gradient descent in a few models for which an exact formula is available for the gradient. In terms of distribution fit, a large number of continuous and discrete distributions are available: Gaussian, exponential, uniform, gamma, Poisson, geometric, etc. In terms of regression, the models available are: linear, logistic, gamma, beta and Poisson.
